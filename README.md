# CoH Admin Tool

Create accounts and promote characters to GM without poking around in the database directly.

## Setup

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/boringcactus/coh-admin-tool/releases/latest) and drop the .exe somewhere convenient.
It doesn't matter where you put it as long as you can find it.

Run the .exe.
You'll be prompted for the port to run the Web server on; be ready to set all your firewalls up to accept connections on that port.
You'll then be prompted for the secret to use for registration and promotion.
This prevents random strangers from creating an account or random users from becoming GMs, so don't let those get out further than you want to.
Configuration will be saved automatically, and you can poke the config file later on if you need to.
